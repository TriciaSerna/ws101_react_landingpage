Content creation: This involves generating and organizing text, images, videos, and other content that will be displayed on the website. Testing and quality assurance: Ensuring the website functions correctly, is user-friendly, and is compatible with different browsers and devices. Deployment: Making the website live on a web server so it can be accessed by users. Maintenance and updates: Regularly updating and maintaining the website to address security vulnerabilities, improve performance, and add new features.</p>
